# Second Hand Treasures

This application was designed to allow small organizations like HOA's and local communities to host a "Marketplace" to post items that local members had for sale. A deployed version of our application can be found on Heroku [here](https://pacific-taiga-59947.herokuapp.com/).

## Functionality

A user has the ability to create an account on the site which uses password hashing and authentication to verify each user. A user can post items to the site to be sold.
